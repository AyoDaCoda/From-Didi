                To think we'd be this close considering how we met and how much I fumbled you is crazy ðŸ˜‚<br> <br>
                Teasing and talking to you is some of the best parts of my day alongside your random spams and though our conversations are well beyond what just friends will talk about, you recently said something, saying the way we were chatting is giving FWB and that has had time to linger in my mind. <br> <br>
                Even with the whole long distance and whatnot, I've had time to look at myself and realize what I have for you is genuine. <br><br>
                Though we may still have some personal problems to sort out on our own, playing these flirting games waiting for the "perfect time" to solidify all of this is unrealistic. <br><br>
                So even though I may not be your perfect prince charming ðŸ˜…, I can at least decide to be the best version of myself for you. <br><br>
                I'm sure you're scared (I am too ðŸ˜‚), but regardless of the road bumps ahead of us that we'll tackle together, I'm taking the initiative to ask... <br><br>
